# WasteDetection

I implemented a YOLOv8-based approach to train a machine learning model for waste detection. The process involved preparing a dataset comprising images and videos that depict various types of waste. Using the YOLOv8 framework, I annotated and labeled the data to create a robust training set. The model was then trained to accurately identify and classify waste in both still images and video frames. After training, I fine-tuned the model to optimize its performance and tested it extensively to ensure reliable detection across diverse scenarios. The resulting model is capable of efficiently identifying waste in real-world images and video footage.

The result of the trained modal is given below:
